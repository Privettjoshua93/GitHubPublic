# Audio Volume Reducer

This script takes a .wav audio file path and a percentage to reduce the volume as input from the user. It processes the audio file by reducing the volume and saves the output.


## Installation

pip install numpy

pip install scipy

test



## Usage

1. Run the script:

python audioreducer.py




2. Follow the prompts to input the file path of a .wav audio file and the percentage by which you want to reduce the volume. The script will process the audio file and save the output with "_reduced_volume" appended to the original file name.
